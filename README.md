# Travelling Salesperson Problem Simulator
## Project information

Author: Cem Kupeli

Dates worked on: March - April 2021

Purpose: Display the performance of different Travelling Salesperson Problem algorithms on a graph with a variable number of nodes

## Summary

This is a simulator I wrote using Java between March and April 2021 that showcases the performance of different TSP algorithms on a graph with a variable number of nodes set by the user. The user can observe how, for example, the runtime of the nearest-neighbour algorithm -- whose time complexity is O(n^2) -- grows much more slowly than the runtime of the exhaustive search algorithm, which has a time complexity of O(n^2 * 2^n) (an [explanation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/travelling-salesman-problem-set-1/) of the time complexity), as n grows larger.
